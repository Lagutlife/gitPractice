At CME, I worked on multiple applications at the same time with different teams. All of them were internal backend applications that were used by other applications.
One of the applications was synchronizing data between different regions, like: America, Asia, Europe.

Another application was to verify messages in different Kafta clusters.


I used to work in pressure. When the project needs to be done in cirtain time. 
Need to do planning how its gonna work.
If the project is in rush first do it manual testing only if you have time automate it.
Need to prioritize the testing on important things on application.

What will be the approach to automate the appllication?
First of all i would talk to other QA existing in this company. Need to understand the application. Ask QA specialist how deep did they test
read requirements
make sure application test is easy to maintain,understand, manage. 
Do you have some deadlines?

How do you prioritize your work. If theres is no order what to do test first than you need to test first what is going to production.

How do you ensure the defects are effectively communicated to the dev team?
Create bug report 
With steps of how re-create the bug 
Attach screen shots, videos, 
Write your test cases in Jira. Documate your bug. 
Go up to Developer and ask questions, explain what you see.

PO BA might be useful when there are not enough requirements

What is your general approach of developing test plans, test cases?
understanding the requirements.
test plans we write in canfluens. what kind of tools we gonna use. 
test cases we write in jira only 
Agile Epic,US,
test writen by me, if you are only one in QA team. If there are more than one than together
first 
if dev dont have test data we can ask is it ok to use Faker or Scanner. What  is test data
You can leave automatoin after the release

How do you prioritze testing task?
Hot fix-production bugs need to go fix
Jira will show us the priority tickets
Priorities will change every day or every week. 

What Challanges did you face and how you solve them?
New feature added
Lack of requirements 
Lack of resources  // resources is another QA or Dev short
Lack of test data  
Server issues 
Poor Communication


Deployment happens in Dev Envirement its there job. QA test it and say to Dev that is good to go they deploy it.
From QA when you ensure that there are no bugs it goes to staging or integration envirement 


How do you define success and when the project went really well?
Feedback from the team 
Retro meeting 
All tests are passed 
Automation testing passed 

How do you stay up to date with latest technologies and testing streategies?
QA groups In LinkedIn
Tech Conferences
Taking courses in Udemi
Coompany provided courses()

Is it anything else i have to know about you as a PM-QA
relationship?
Good communicator
Detail oriented person
Good within skills 
Project management skills 
If i need something You will be the first to know



Sanity test - lighter version of smoke test. Make sure appliction is up and running. Basicly you dont check behavior of the. After every deployment
Smoke test - everyday
Regression test - UI ones in sprints before product release.Back end every day for you UI not every day
Integreation test - make sure one app (old version in tech world it called built) works with a app (new version)
Functional test - when you run only function 


KARATE
KT - knowwledge transfer
URL - host name or ending point 
URI - is ending point 
In karate is good always do attache documentation
When we define the value we need to use '#string' it means value MUST be string not null if there is '##string' the value can be null
if its integer '#number'
for array '##array'
